I think Luke's point of view of convincing people to go on a Seagoing Cowboy trip. ,"Topic: I think Luke's point of view of convincing people to go on a Seagoing Cowboy trip.

- Luke wanted to be a Seagoing Cowboy. A cattle boat came up and gave him the opportunity to be in the Seagoing Cowboy program. Luke's friend inited him to go on the cattle boat because his friend knew he wanted to be on one. Luke's life changed right after graduation.

Luke did not know his life would change soon. It was 1945, World War ll was over in Europe, and many counties were left in the ruins. UNRRA hired "" Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that wereshipped over seas. It says that Luke and Don signed up.

He crossed the Antlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War ll. Luke also found time on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.

Luke said "" It made more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" Then awareness stayed with him. The cowboys played beseball and volleyball games on board when Luke was on. There was plenty of games they played on board.

Helping at his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared him is what the paragrph said so what it is saying is when he was little then he went to his aunt Katie's farm and played around and it helped him with his future with animals.        
- I like to support Luke for being brave to go out in the bigh world 
- Luke joined the program. He decided to because his freiend offered it to him.

Also it was a once and a lifetime opportunity for him. He kenw he couldn't past up the opportunity. Luke also joined because he wanted to help people after World War ll.

Some evidence that Luke want to go to the program is? Luke want to go on the ship back and forth from the oceans. Also Luke could be drafted in the miliatry service because he turned 18. Luke said ""The cattle-boat trip were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy."" Also it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to China.

The conclussion to the story is? Luke want to join the program. Some evidence that Luke said is ""I'm grateful for the opportunity."" Also Luke said ""It made me more aware of people of there countries and their needs.""

Finally Luke said that the awareness stayed with him. Which help leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

The text also states,Luke said that awareness stayed with him leading his familly to host a numberofinternational students and exchange visitors for many years.

The text states,Luke got to see all these different countries like china,and Europe. The text also states that Luke got to tour an excavated castle in Crete. Another thing that Luke said is sometimes you won't no when it will happen       
- When you go and become a Seagoing Cowboy you get to live on a boat with farm animals. Also while on your way to your distanation you get to stop at cool places. You can stop Greece,Italy,& China.

I agree with the claim against the value of using this technology to read student's emotional expressions. ,"- This technology could be used to help students learn to read emotions. 

- It could also help teachers understand if some of their students are enjoying the lesson. Or it could possibly be used to tell when the students are lying to their teachers. The Facial Action Coding System shows the six basic emotion that are associated with the movements of ones facial muscles. The basic emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This technology can also identify mixed emotions. 

- It wouldn't change the emotion the students feeling. It also wouldn't help with the students education. Its over all just a waste of time.

In all that they're saying, its probably a natural landform.
